# js_webs_craping

This script is a specialized tool crafted in Node.js and Puppeteer for web scraping and data manipulation. To get started, you'll first need to install Node.js, npm, and Puppeteer. You can do this by executing the following commands:
sudo apt install nodejs
sudo apt install npm
npm install puppeteer

After installation, the next step is to investigate the target website's HTML structure to identify the elements you wish to extract. Once you've determined this, you can proceed to write your JavaScript or TypeScript code to parse and format the data in the manner you desire.

I opted to use Node.js and Puppeteer for this project because JavaScript and TypeScript excel in the realm of dynamic web scraping, offering both flexibility and robustness for various scraping tasks.
